    "description": "DSA problem :  We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm: If the length of the string is 1, stop. If the length of the string is > 1, do the following: Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y. Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x. Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y. Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.",
    "prompt": "Validate whether the submitted solution correctly determines if s2 is a scrambled version of s1 as defined in the description. If the solution is incorrect, generate a testing example that breaks the logic and provide a corrected version of the solution with explanation.",
